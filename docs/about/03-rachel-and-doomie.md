# Rachel and Doomslayer

Now that I've sold myself as a software developer, let me introduce you to the loves of my life.

**On the left is Rachel!**
She's a nursing student, a wonderful person, and makes me very happy!

**On The Right is Doomslayer**
Doomslayer is a cutie patootie who's always smiling and just loves life. He's a Corgi / Blue Heeler Mix
