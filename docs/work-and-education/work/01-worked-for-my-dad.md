# Worked For My Dad

I come from a long line of Sign Shop owners. Way back in the 1950's there was actually a Higger Sign Shop. Then my Grandpa started one called Silverescent signs, and now my dad has one called [United Visual Branding](https://uvbrand.com/)

They make some pretty cool stuff, check out this Hard Rock Cafe guitar. ![Hard Rock Cafe guitar](https://uvbrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Custom-Exterior-Sign-Tampa-4.jpg)

Anyways, when I was a kid, I was encouraged to "Make my own money" by working for my dad. So in the summers I would do simple work like sweeping floors or organizing files.

As I got older I got to do some cooler stuff like...

- Machine Parts
- Operate Heavy Machinery
  - Saws
  - Hydraulic Bending Machines
- Weld Stuff (Although I never was any good at it)
- Apply Vinyl to letter faces
- Run a CNC router bed

While none of this felt like what I wanted to do with my life long-term, I think that working in this kind of environment was an extremely humbling, and pragmatic experience. I'm very thankful I can work a drill, build something, and have an appreciation for the type of work that most people do (Some kind of Manual Labor).
