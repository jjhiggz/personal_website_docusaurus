# Flatiron Software Instructor

Alright, now we're getting to the good stuff.

After quitting Great Southwestern Construction, I was a student at Flatiron, and I absolutely loved it! More on that [here](#). The Denver campus in particular was something truly special. They basically broke most of the corporate assigned cirriculum and did whatever they wanted.

Here are some things I REALLY loved about the Denver campus

- A STRONG emphasis on the emotional side of learning
- Really knowledgable education experts
- Really knowledgable tech experts
- Open-ness to do things differently

As a Teacher, here are some things I got to do that most entry level teachers wouldn't be allowed to do.

- Teach classes
  - Day 1 I was teaching formal lessons
- Talk to Students about emotional issues
- Continue Learning from Mentor
  - Tests
  - Vue
  - Typescript
  - Functional Programming
  - Flutter
  - Proffessional Development

Overall this is probably the best employment experience I've ever had, but only because of the direct people that I worked with, not because of Flatiron as a corporation.
