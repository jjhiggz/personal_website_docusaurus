# Carpenter at Concrete Plant

When I first moved out to Colorado (With an Engineering Degree) I needed a job. So I got one at a Concrete plant. Unfortunately I was still doing manual labor despite a degree where I learned high level mathematics, and busted my butt off for 14 hours a day in a library.

**But money is money.**

So I woke up at 3am everyday, went to the plant, and cut out shapes from styrofoam blocks until the sun went down. That was the first and only time I learned firsthand how not seeing the sun in weeks will actually give you severe depression. Still the people there were all good, hard working people, and I don't regret having worked there for one second!
