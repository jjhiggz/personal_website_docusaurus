# Transmission Line Estimator

After the concrete plant, I was a transmission line estimator at Great Southwestern Construction. At first it was actually a pretty cool job.

I got to learn about:

- Transmission Lines
- Construction Business
- Corporate Environments
- Excel (To the Max)

I wound up leaving because after a year and a half it got extremely boring. Every day I would call subcontractors, ask for prices and put them into an excel spreadsheet. Alternatively I might call a project manager and ask "Hey how does this site look", then based off of what they said (you guessed it) fill out an excel spreadsheet.

By no means was it a bad job, but I really love learning and wasn't getting to do enough of it there.
